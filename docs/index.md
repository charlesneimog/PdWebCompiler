# Introduction

## <h2 align="center"> **What is PdWebCompiler?** </h2>

`PdWebCompiler` allows bring PureData functionality to web browsers using Web Audio technologies. This tool stands out from other approaches like [hvcc](https://github.com/Wasted-Audio/hvcc) and [WebPd](https://github.com/sebpiq/WebPd) because it compiles the [libpd](https://github.com/libpd/libpd) source, this is possible mainly because of the work of [claudeha](https://github.com/claudeha). You can compile any PureData vanilla patch and most of the externals.

In addition to the evident advantages inherent in streamlining the development of entirely online audio applications through a fully visual approach, my personal scholarly interest as a composer centers on the creation of electroacoustic works and live electronics performances. This focus is underpinned by the aspiration to facilitate performer access to compositions without the need for configuring intricate PureData patches, replete with numerous libraries and susceptible to errors arising from platform disparities. 

Additionally, a significant aspect of my research delves into the capacity of WebAudioApps to serve as an effective means for preserving works within the realm of live electronic music.
