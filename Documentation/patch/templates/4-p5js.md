# <h1 align="center">Template <code>4</code>: p5js and pd4web</h1>

!!! tip "Template designed for those who know how to program"
    Learn how to program, I really recommend watch the [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) channel. It is a great channel to learn how to program in a fun way. 

This template is for the combination of `p5js` and `pd4web`. It is a simple template that uses the `p5js` library to create a canvas and pd4web to create a patch that can be used to control the canvas (or vice-versa).

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/p5js.png" width="80%" style="cursor: pointer; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" onclick="window.open('./../templates/p5js', '_blank');" >
</p>

    :octicons-download-16: [Download Patch Template](../patches/template-4.zip)
</p>

There is no much to say about this template, it just use a personalized `index.html` and `sketch.js`, where you can code you `p5js` code. 

Just download and have fun. If you have any question, please, let me know. If you have some questions about `p5js` or `pd4web` you can ask me too. I will be glad to help you.
