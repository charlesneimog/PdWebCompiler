# <h1 align="center">Template <code>3</code>: Choir and Phones</h1>


This template is just a reuse of the template used in the pieces `Moteto (2023)` and `Pandem√¥nico (2024)`. Pieces for choir and smartphone. Where you can do some patch with guide notes (or just the score) for the singer.

The result will be something like this:

## <h2 align="center">What should your patch include?</h2>

In your patch, you have these options to set using **senders**, for example, `[s composer`], `[s title]`, `[s duration-bar]`, `[s piece-duration-bar]`, `[s poem-phrase]` and `[s pitch-syl]`:

- `composer`: The composer name;
- `title`: Title of the piece;
- `duration-bar`: A number between 0 and 100 for the bar line (control the bar above the score);
- `piece-duration-bar`: A number between 0 and 100 for the bar line (control the bar below the phrase);
- `poem-phrase`: The complete phrase of the poem (or anything else), for example `minha frase`.
- `pitch-syl`: A list with the pitchname and the syllable, for example `C4 fra`.

In your patch, you have these options to set using **receivers**, for example, `[r naipe]`:
