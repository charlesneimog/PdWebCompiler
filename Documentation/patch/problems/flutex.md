<h2 align="center"><code>flutex.c</code> problems</h2>

If this happens, probably is because you are using some object that I don't use in my patches. So, you need to report this problem to me and I will try to solve this. 

To report the problem you must share the patch that is causing the problem, without the patch is impossible to solve the problem. You can always reduce the patch to the minimum size that is causing the problem. 

Usually, these problems have an error related with `flutex.c` file.

!!! bug "How to report?"
    You must report the problem using the GitHub issues. You can report the problem in the [pd4web repository](https://github.com/charlesneimog/pd4web/issues).
