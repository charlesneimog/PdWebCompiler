# <h1 align="center">Template <code>5</code>: Tutorial Patches</h1>

Patch side by side with some text to explain the patch. The result will be something like this:

<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/tutorial.png" width="80%" style="border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" onclick="window.open('./../templates/tutorial', '_blank')">
</p>

To make the description again we use a markdown file. The markdown is called `tutorial.md` and is located in the `WebPatch` folder. The content of the file should be edited after compilation of the patch.

As in the previous template, inside `tutorial.md` you can write some description about the patch. The file uses markdown to render, you can check the complet syntax in https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/. Below the example of main command:

``` md
# Title 1
## Title 2
### Title 3

**bold text**
*italic text**

* this one item
* this is another item
```
