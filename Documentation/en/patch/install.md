# Install pd4web
 
 To compile you first need to install `pd4web`. There is two ways to install it.
 
 - Using the PureData Patch, if you don't use python or the command line.
 - Using the Python Package, if you know how to use a command line.

To use the `pd4web` object in PureData, follow these steps:

1. Install [PureData](https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130/).
2. Open PureData.
3. Navigate to **Help** :material-arrow-right: **Find Externals**.
4. Search for `pd4web`.
5. Click the **Install** button.

!!! info 
    You will also need Python. On Linux and macOS, Python is likely pre-installed. For Windows, you'll need to install Python separately (it's as simple as installing PureData or any other program).
