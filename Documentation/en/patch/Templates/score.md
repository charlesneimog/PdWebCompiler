In this template you have access to a patch that receives image files (from scores) and renders it side by side with your patch. The result will be something like this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="../hand-pose.png" width="80%" style="border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
</p>

You make your patch and the score file can be set using the object `[s pd4web-score]`. I recomend to use svg files, but you can use any image file.
